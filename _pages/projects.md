## Completed Projects

[Identifying fractures in spinal images](https://github.com/elizabethwillard/rsna-cervical-spine-detection)

[Identifying different lung diseases using COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://github.com/elizabethwillard/w207-final-project)

[Using Yelp to generate fake reviews](https://github.com/elizabethwillard/ece498final/blob/master/ECE498_Willard_Edrington.docx)
- The goal of this project was to create fake reviews using a dataset from Yelp. In order to do this, a recurring neural network (RNN) would be used, as they are a common model used for pattern prediction. In tandem with the RNN, a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture will also be implemented using Keras framework in Google Colab.
