title: Using Github Actions to Push a Containerized Streamlit Application to ECR and Deploy to an EC2 Instance

Recently, I used Github Actions to automate the deployment of a Streamlit application I was using for my capstone project, Charge Buddy. 
As we draw closer to the finish line, the risk that manual deployment introduces becomes too much at a certain point. Today, I wanted to go over the steps I took to write a simple Github Actions workflow that automated the deployment of our Streamlit application. 

1. Create an Elastic Container Registry repository to store your Docker images

2. Configure an IAM role for Github Actions to use 
Create Role -> Web Identity
Identity Provider: token.actions.githubusercontent.com 
Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
Github Organization (This is the name of the owner of the Github repo you are working with)

You can skip over attaching policies to this role at this moment. 
3. Navigate to the IAM Role you created and go to "Permission Policies" -> "Add Permissions" -> Create an inline policy 
For the ECR-Registry Value, you will be using your AWS account ID, which should be the long numeric value in the URI portion of the ECR registry entry. 
The [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Repositories.html) says "By default, your account has read and write access to the repositories in your default registry (aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com)."
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                "ecr:PutImage",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:[ECR-Registry Value]:repository:[Name of ECR Repository]"
        }
    ]
}
```
The inline policy should resemble the code above. 

4. I initially began by adapting the workflow from [Deploying to Amazon ECS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-amazon-elastic-container-service)
