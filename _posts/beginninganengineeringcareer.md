1. I wish I knew that it was okay to leave a job after a couple of years, whether or not they paid for your school.

2. I wish I knew that it's okay to be rejected. After the first few rejections I received beginning the job hunt anew now, I realized that, even though the process involves me, it's not really about me. It's hard not to personally judge yourself and try and estimate what your shortcomings are after being rejected. But, going through the intern hiring process and being on the other side of the table, so to speak, has helped me realize that, at the end of the day, it's too much work to truly and thoroughly evaluate each candidate and give them their due. 
3. The concept of "political capital" at the office
4. That I should save the best work for myself and my family, not my job.
